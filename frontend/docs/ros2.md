# Robot Operating System 2 (ROS2)

ROS2 is a flexible framework for writing robot software. It's a collection of tools, libraries, and conventions that aim to simplify the task of creating complex and robust robot behaviors across a wide variety of robotic platforms.

## Key Concepts of ROS2

- **Nodes**: Executable processes that perform computation.
- **Topics**: Buses over which nodes exchange messages (publish/subscribe).
- **Services**: Request/reply mechanisms for direct communication between nodes.
- **Actions**: Long-running tasks with feedback and preemption capabilities.
- **Packages**: Units for organizing ROS2 code (nodes, libraries, datasets).

## Why ROS2 for Physical AI?

ROS2 provides a standardized and modular approach to robot software development. Its distributed architecture allows for concurrent development and deployment of various robot functionalities, which is crucial for the complexity of Physical AI and Humanoid Robotics projects. It supports multiple programming languages (C++, Python) and is designed for real-time performance and embedded systems.
