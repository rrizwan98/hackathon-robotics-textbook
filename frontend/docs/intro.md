# Introduction to Physical AI & Humanoid Robotics

Physical AI and Humanoid Robotics represent the cutting edge of artificial intelligence, bringing intelligent systems into the real world. This textbook explores the foundational concepts, technologies, and applications that enable robots to perceive, reason, and act in complex environments, often mimicking human form and capabilities.

## What is Physical AI?

Physical AI refers to intelligent systems that interact with the physical world. Unlike purely software-based AI, Physical AI embodies its intelligence in physical form, allowing it to sense, manipulate, and move within its environment. Key aspects include:
- **Perception**: Using sensors (cameras, lidar, touch) to understand the environment.
- **Manipulation**: Interacting with objects through grippers, arms, and other effectors.
- **Locomotion**: Moving through space (walking, rolling, flying).
- **Cognition**: Planning, decision-making, and learning based on sensory input.

## Why Humanoid Robotics?

Humanoid robots are a specific class of physical AI that are designed to resemble the human body. This design choice offers several advantages:
- **Versatility**: Human-centric environments (homes, factories, hospitals) are designed for human interaction, making humanoid robots naturally suited to operate within them.
- **Collaboration**: The familiar form factor can facilitate easier human-robot interaction and collaboration.
- **Research Platform**: Humanoid robots serve as excellent platforms for studying human locomotion, manipulation, and cognitive processes.

## Course Overview

This course will guide you through the essential components of building and understanding Physical AI and Humanoid Robotics systems, from theoretical foundations to practical implementation using tools like ROS2 and various simulation environments.
