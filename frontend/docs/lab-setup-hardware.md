# Lab Setup & Hardware

A well-equipped laboratory is essential for practical experimentation in Physical AI and Humanoid Robotics. This chapter guides you through setting up a robotics lab, understanding necessary hardware components, and ensuring a safe and productive work environment.

## Essential Lab Equipment

- **Workbenches and Tools**: Sturdy work surfaces, soldering stations, multimeters, power supplies, and hand tools are fundamental.
- **Computing Resources**: High-performance workstations for simulation, data processing, and AI model training.
- **3D Printer/CNC Machine**: For rapid prototyping of custom robot parts and fixtures.
- **Safety Gear**: Eye protection, gloves, and fire extinguishers are crucial when working with electronics and machinery.

## Robotic Hardware Components

- **Robots/Manipulators**: Industrial robot arms, mobile robots, or humanoid platforms (e.g., Robotis OP3, Unitree Go1).
- **Sensors**:
    - **Vision**: RGB-D cameras (e.g., Intel RealSense, Azure Kinect), LiDAR (e.g., Velodyne, RPLIDAR).
    - **Proprioception**: IMUs, encoders for joint positions.
    - **Tactile**: Force-torque sensors, tactile arrays.
- **Actuators**: Servos, DC motors, stepper motors, hydraulic/pneumatic cylinders.
- **Embedded Systems**: Microcontrollers (e.g., Arduino, ESP32), single-board computers (e.g., Raspberry Pi, NVIDIA Jetson) for on-robot computation.
- **Communication Hardware**: Ethernet switches, Wi-Fi routers, serial converters.

## Safety Protocols

Operating a robotics lab requires strict adherence to safety protocols to prevent accidents and protect personnel.
- **Emergency Stop Systems**: Clearly marked and easily accessible emergency stop buttons.
- **Robot Safe Zones**: Define clear boundaries for robot operation and ensure personnel stay out of these zones during autonomous operation.
- **Power Management**: Proper handling of high-voltage components and battery systems.
- **Training**: All lab users must be trained on equipment operation and safety procedures.
