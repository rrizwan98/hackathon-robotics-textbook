# Capstone Project

The Capstone Project is the culmination of your learning in Physical AI and Humanoid Robotics. It provides an opportunity to apply the knowledge and skills acquired throughout the course to a real-world problem or a significant research question. This chapter outlines the expectations, process, and potential areas of focus for your capstone experience.

## Project Goals

- **Integrate Knowledge**: Combine concepts from ROS2, simulation, VLA, and humanoid robotics.
- **Problem-Solving**: Identify a robotics problem and propose an innovative solution.
- **System Design**: Develop a comprehensive design for a robotic system or a significant subsystem.
- **Implementation**: Build and test a prototype or a simulated implementation of your design.
- **Presentation and Documentation**: Clearly articulate your project's goals, methodology, results, and future work.

## Project Phases

1.  **Proposal**: Define your project scope, objectives, methodology, and expected outcomes.
2.  **Design**: Develop detailed architectural and engineering designs for your chosen solution.
3.  **Implementation & Testing**: Build and rigorously test your prototype or simulated system.
4.  **Demonstration**: Present your working system and its capabilities.
5.  **Final Report**: Document your entire project, including challenges, solutions, and future recommendations.

## Potential Project Areas

-   **Humanoid Interaction**: Develop a humanoid robot that can perform complex tasks through natural language commands.
-   **Autonomous Navigation**: Implement robust navigation and obstacle avoidance for a mobile robot in a dynamic environment.
-   **Advanced Manipulation**: Design a robotic arm to perform delicate assembly tasks or interact with deformable objects.
-   **Robotics for Healthcare**: Create a robotic assistant for hospitals or home care, focusing on specific patient needs.
-   **Simulation for Training**: Develop a high-fidelity simulation environment to train AI agents for complex robotics tasks.
