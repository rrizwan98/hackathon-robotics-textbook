## Question 1: Primary Authentication Mechanism

**Context**: The platform requires user authentication, and the functional requirement FR-012 states that it must support either OAuth (e.g., GitHub, Google) or a simpler email/password-based system.

**What we need to know**: Which authentication method should be the primary one for registered users?

**Suggested Answers**:

| Option | Answer | Implications |
| :----- | :-------------------------- | :------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| A | **OAuth (GitHub, Google)** | Faster integration, leveraging existing providers, potentially less user friction. |
| B | **Email/Password** | Full control over user accounts, requires implementing password management/security. |
| C | **Both (allow selection)** | Provides flexibility, but adds complexity to implementation and management. |
| Custom | Provide your own answer | Explain your preferred authentication method and its justification. |

**Your choice**: _[Wait for user response]_
