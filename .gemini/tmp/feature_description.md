Project: Physical AI & Humanoid Robotics Textbook + AI Portal ## Purpose & Goals We are building an integrated platform that serves as both a comprehensive textbook and an AI-native portal for Physical AI & Humanoid Robotics education and research. The main goals: - Provide structured content: textbook-style chapters covering robotics theory, simulation, ROS2, embodied AI, VLA (Vision-Language-Action), humanoid robotics, lab setups, etc. - Embed interactive AI features: RAG-based chatbot tied to textbook content, ability for users to ask questions about content, and to ask AI about user-selected text (e.g., highlight & “Ask AI”). - Support multilingual accessibility: provide content primarily in English, but include mandatory Urdu translation option for each chapter. - Provide personalization: registered/logged-in users can get personalized content views, track progress, and have features like “My notes”, “My progress”, etc. - Maintain high quality & maintainability: All features, content, and backend/frontend should follow consistent standards, testable, and production-ready. ## Users & Roles Define at least these user roles: - Content Reader (anonymous / logged-out) — read textbook chapters, search content, use chatbot with limited features. - Registered User (logged-in) — full access: personalized view, bookmarks/notes, progress tracking, translation toggle, enhanced chatbot. - Admin / Content Manager — add/edit textbook content, manage translations, review & publish chapters. - AI / Backend Engineer — maintain backend services, RAG pipeline, vector store, API endpoints. - Frontend Engineer — manage UI, embedding chatbot, translation toggle, user-auth and UI components. - DevOps / Deployment Engineer — manage deployment (frontend, backend), CI/CD, DB, vector store, hosting. ## High-Level Features / Functional Requirements 1. **Book Content Structure** - Chapters & sub-chapters as per defined course modules (Intro, ROS2, Simulation, Humanoid Robotics, VLA, Capstone). - Support for Markdown-based content, with code blocks, images, diagrams, and tables. - Support for dual-language: English + Urdu translation (toggle). - Search & navigation: Table of contents, search across book content. 2. **RAG Chatbot Integration** - Embed chatbot in book UI: persistent sidebar or overlay. - Chatbot answers based solely on book content (and optionally user-selected text for context). - The chatbot must cite references: when answering, show which chapter/section (or line) the answer is derived from. - Allowed to answer in English or Urdu, depending on user preference. 3. **User Authentication & Personalization** - Sign-up / Sign-in (via OAuth or simpler auth mechanism) to register users. - Store user metadata: background (software/hardware), preferences (language, theme), progress, bookmarks, notes. - Personalized UI: show user-specific items (bookmarks, reading progress, language preference). 4. **Backend & Infrastructure** - Backend services (e.g. using FastAPI) for authentication, user data, content-serving APIs, RAG query endpoints. - Database for user data (e.g. PostgreSQL via Neon serverless). - Vector store for embeddings (e.g. Qdrant Cloud). - Content storage for book Markdown + translations + assets. - Deployment: frontend (book UI + chatbot) as static SPA (e.g. via Docusaurus) deployed via GitHub Pages or Vercel; backend as cloud-hosted API service. 5. **Testing, Quality & Maintainability** - Automated tests for backend APIs. - Validation for content rendering across languages. - Spec-driven workflow: specifications (spec.md), technical plan (plan.md), tasks (tasks/), code generated via AI agents following spec. - Version control for content, specs, code. 6. **Accessibility & Internationalization** - Support for multiple languages (English, Urdu); proper UI/UX for right-to-left (RTL) for Urdu. - Ensure readability on multiple devices (desktop, mobile). - Proper accessibility standards (e.g. alt text for images, semantic HTML). 7. **Security & Privacy** - Secure authentication. - Secure storage of user data; do not leak sensitive data. - Sanitize user inputs (especially for chatbot / backend). - Compliance with data privacy — ensure only permitted data stored, and user consent for storing metadata. ## Constraints & Non-Functional Requirements - Performance: frontend should load quickly; backend responses (especially RAG chatbot) should respond within reasonable latency. - Scalability: able to handle multiple concurrent users, and growing content base. - Maintainability: codebase maintainable, easy to add new chapters/translations/features. - Portability: AI-agent-based code generation should be reproducible; configuration in code/spec files, not hard-coded. - Documentation: every feature, API, content update should be documented. ## Success Criteria / What “Done” Looks Like - Full book content scaffolded (all modules/chapter placeholders), with English + Urdu support. - Working book UI (static) with navigation. - Working backend + API + database + vector store + embeddings. - Chatbot embedded — answers correctly based on book content, with source references. - User auth + personalization + translation toggle working. - Automated tests passing. - Deployment working (frontend + backend). ## Why This Project Matters / Use Cases - Makes advanced robotics + AI education accessible and interactive. - Enables students and researchers to learn, search, and query content easily. - Combines textbook + interactive AI — efficient learning and reference. - Supports bilingual community (English + Urdu) — increases accessibility. ---
